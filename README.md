# Overview
Created based on UniTask Pub-Sub by hadashiA. The usage is similar but more simpler and now works with TypeRef if you use one

All signal now should implement ISignal and this is done also for easier filter for all signal class

if you want fully featured one without ISignal implementation, use the original one here: https://github.com/hadashiA/UniTaskPubSub
